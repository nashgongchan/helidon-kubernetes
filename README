This covers the overview of how to setup the helidon lab in kubernetes. You are assumed to have already pushed up your docker containers to the registry
Note that this is for a *public* registry, if you are going to do this for a private registry you will need to setup the docker login secret and will 
need to update the service deployment files with that.

First thing to do is to install helm - this is much easier than configuring the services yourself (think of helm as a 
package manager for kuberneties.) See the instructions in the helm folder

Next is probabaly setting up the kubernetes web dashboard, this is easier than learning all of the manual kubectl commands to examine things 
follow the instructions in the kubernetes dashboard directory to install it, create the admin user and set up the port forwarding

You can install the setup using a basic kubernetes setup and an externaly facing loadbalancer. The runLoadBalancer.sh script
in the basic-kuberneties directory will do this for you. 

If you want to then use ingress as a web front end follow the instructions to install and configure ingress. Note that once you've got the basic
ingress install setup it's probably best to stop the existing configuration using the stop.sh script then start it up using ingress with
the runIngress.sh script in the Ingress folder

To setup prometheus to monitor the system and grafana to display visuals then look at the instructions in the prometheus folder
